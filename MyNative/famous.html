        <p>Shri Mahakaleshwar of Ujjayini is known among the twelve celebrated Jyotirlingas in India.
            The glory of Mahakaleshwar temple has been vividly described in various Purans. Starting with
            Kalidasa,
            many sanskrit poets have eulogized this temple in emotive terms. Ujjain used to be the central point for
            calculation of Indian time and Mahakala was considered as the distinctive presiding deity of Ujjain.The
            presiding deity of time, Shiva, in all his splendor, reigns eternal in Ujjain. The temple of
            Mahakaleshwar,
            its shikhara soaring into the skies, an imposing fa√ßade against the skyline, evokes primordial awe and
            reverence
            with its majesty. The Mahakal dominates the life of the city and its people, even in the midst of the busy

            routine of modern preoccupations, and provides an unbreakable link with past traditions. One of the 12
            Jyotirlingas
            in India, the lingam at the Mahakal is believed to be swayambhu (born of itself), deriving currents of power
            (Shakti)
            from within itself as against the other images and lingams which are ritually established and invested with
            mantra-shakti.
